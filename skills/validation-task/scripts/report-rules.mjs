// What one scenario entry has to satisfy, shared by the two things that ask it:
// `capture-scenario.mjs`, the moment a scenario finishes and while its page is
// still open, and `check-report.mjs`, again over the assembled report.
//
// ONE implementation, deliberately. The capture-time check earns its place only
// by predicting the end-of-run one: a report that would fail at the end fails
// EARLY, when re-driving the scenario is still free. Two copies of these rules
// would drift, and the early check would stop predicting anything.
//
// NO DEPENDENCIES beyond node builtins — the same constraint `check-report.mjs`
// documents. This ships inside the skill and runs from a project clone where none
// of our node_modules are installed, and NODE_PATH does not apply to ESM.
