// Package envidp installs an environment's own identity provider (the
// "second tier" or "T2" Thunder — see deployments/design/two-tier-thunder.md)
// and its API Platform gateway, and writes the binding record that lets
// thunder-app-operator and aep-api find it.
//
// aectl only ever provisions into one (org, environment) pair — the same
// Environment cmd.ocPipelineSourceEnvironment() addresses, in the namespace
// cmd.ocOrgNamespace() names. Both default to "default" but follow config
// (oc.pipeline_source_environment and oc.default_org_namespace
// respectively); this package's Org/Env must resolve the same way
// platform_gateway.go's checkGatewayIngress/applyGatewayIngressConfig do, or
// it would target a different Environment object than the one those
// functions actually read and patch. This package takes both as input rather
// than importing either, so cmd remains the single place that decides which
// (org, environment) AEP installs into.
//
// Deliberately independent of Agent Manager at runtime: it never calls
// amp-api, never mirrors Agent Manager's Helm values shape, and derives
// names from a fixed convention instead of Agent Manager's own naming
// library (deployments/scripts/setup-environment-thunder.sh sources that
// library from a separate Agent Manager checkout — not something a portable
// aectl binary can depend on). For Org="default" this convention produces
// the same name that library would for a short, unhashed input; see
// Config's doc comment for the collision risk a longer Org or Env leaves.

	// republishes the PublicURL built from it as every generated app's OIDC
	// issuer (binding.go's record → its own binding.go → the app's `issuer`

	// generated is redirected here. On any cluster reachable by more than
	// its own host, a value that resolves only to loopback breaks that
	// sign-in — which is why this is configuration and not a constant.

	// (its ENV_IDP_BASE_DOMAIN, deployments/scripts/setup-agent-manager.sh).
