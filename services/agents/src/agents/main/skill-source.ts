 * The skill-supply seam (ADR-0002 + shared-workspace-volume): ONE interface
 * the catalog builder (`prompt.ts`) and the skill loaders
 * (`tools/skill-tools.ts`) consume. The one production implementation is
 * `SnapshotSkillSource` (`conversation/load-workspace.ts`): the catalog is
 * scanned from the turn's immutable `_skills` snapshot dir and
 * `loadSkill`/`loadSkillReference` read bodies from disk ON DEMAND, so
 * progressive disclosure is truly lazy (D4 immutability makes the mid-turn
 * reads race-free). A skill-free turn uses `EMPTY_SKILL_SOURCE`.
