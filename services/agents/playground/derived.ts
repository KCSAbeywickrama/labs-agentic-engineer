/**
 * The post-turn derived-artifact pipeline, as ONE unit: given what a turn
 * changed and the resulting snapshot, refresh every derived view on disk.
 * This is the playground's stand-in for what the BFF owns in production —
 * a single seam, so the turn loop stays chat mechanics only.
 *
 *   *.dsl                 → sibling .excalidraw          (compile)
 *   design.json (all components) → specs/design/cell-diagram.gen.json
 *
 * Everything written here ends in .excalidraw / .gen.json — the extensions
 * readSnapshot excludes — so derived output can never leak into the agent's
 * bundle or the prompt.
