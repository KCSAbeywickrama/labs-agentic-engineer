// it); the other two are new.

// dependencyBlocker is the SINGLE place that maps an `external` dependency's
// already-computed Status/Reason onto a user-facing blocker: the drawer item
// kind + a plain-language description. Both preflight.externalItems (the
// drawer's GET-time item emission) and Service.dependencyGateFailures (the
// build-time hard gate) call this exact function, so the two surfaces can
// never drift apart.
//
// Status/Reason are NOT recomputed here — models.ComputeDependencyStatus
// (services/aep-api/models/dependency_status.go) is the single authority for
// deriving them, and it already ran, with fresh resolver-port lookups,
// upstream of every caller of this function: artifacts.ArtifactStore's
// resolveExternalDependencies calls it inside ReadDesign/AssembleDesignFrom,
// which is what both PreflightDesignReader.ReadDesignComponents (preflight.go)
// and the build hard gate's own fresh ReadDesignComponents call (below) return
// through. Re-deriving the precedence table here — or re-invoking
// ComputeDependencyStatus a second time with a second, independently-wired set
// of resolver ports — would duplicate live catalog/registry calls within one
// logical preflight/build computation and risk the two computations
// disagreeing if registry state changes mid-request; reading the
// already-computed Status/Reason field instead (exactly how the pre-existing
// org-service item, orgServiceItems, already works) keeps ComputeDependencyStatus
// invoked exactly once per fresh design read.
//
// Only `external` dependencies are classified here: `org-service`'s own
// unresolved/blocked/ambiguous states keep their existing "org-service" item
// kind (orgServiceItems, unchanged) and are gated at design-save time
// (design.SaveAndProceed's firstUnresolvedDependency) rather than here — the
// orphaned gate this task restores is specifically the `external` one Task 1
// dropped (dependency-management migration plan, the P4 proceed-gate note).

// dependencyGateFailures is the build-time hard gate (dependency-management

// read (never the client-supplied inputs, never a cached preflight response —
// "re-run the computation" means invoke, never copy) walks every service
// component's `external` dependencies and maps each still-blocked one
// (ambiguous, or unresolved with needs-spec/needs-input) through the exact
// same dependencyBlocker used by preflight.externalItems, into the existing
// InputFailure shape (handlers_build.go's BuildResponse.failures). A doctored
// client that skips the drawer (or supplies no/insufficient inputs) cannot
// bypass this: the gate reads the design's Status/Reason at HEAD AFTER
// InputsCoordinator.ApplyPreTag has had a chance to commit any drawer-supplied
// resolution (e.g. a pasted external-spec) — Run() calls this AFTER ApplyPreTag
// but BEFORE the tag-cut, so a legitimate resolution submitted with THIS build
// request is reflected, while an unresolved dependency the client didn't
// actually fix still blocks.
//
// A nil design reader (composition root didn't wire one) fails OPEN — no
// design read means no dependency can be classified, mirroring every other
// nil-safe port in this package (Coord, Tasks).
