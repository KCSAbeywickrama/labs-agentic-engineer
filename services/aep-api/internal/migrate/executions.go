// RunExecutions creates the admission-mutex partial unique index on the
// executions table (docs/design/tasks-github-native.md §5): at most one active
// (queued|running) Execution per (repo, issue_number, kind, component). This is
// the authoritative dispatch lock — the funnel's gate check is advisory, and
// dispatch begins with INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING against this index, so
// racing entrants (webhook delivery ∥ reconciliation sweep) resolve to exactly
// one admitted Execution. AutoMigrate creates the executions table from the
// model but cannot express a partial (WHERE-clause) index, so it is added here.
//
// `component` is part of the key so the path-based build fan-out can admit one
// active build per component under a single merged PR (an incident that alerts
// on one component whose fix spans others). For coding/ops rows component is
// constant per Task, so including it is a no-op for their one-active-per-Task
// semantics. The pre-fan-out index keyed only (repo, issue_number, kind) is
// superseded by CREATE-then-DROP so an already-migrated DB is upgraded in place
// without leaving the mutex unenforced.
//
// Idempotent: the CREATE/DROP IF (NOT) EXISTS pair is a no-op on re-run, and the
// step no-ops entirely if the table is not present yet.
