package validation

// repair_issues.go — turning a failed validation attempt into ordinary work.
//
// This is the same rule eventcore/mint.go states for every other
// platform-detected failure: the platform files an issue, the issue joins the
// milestone's working set, and the next cycle works it like any other. Validation
// was the one detected failure that did not follow it — it settled the run instead
// — which is why a failing acceptance criterion needed a human to notice.
//
// The bodies are PROSE. Nothing parses them back: the supervisor learns the
// outcome from the next attempt's report, not from these issues.

// MintRepairIssues files ONE issue per failed scenario and returns their
// numbers — including the ones it resolved onto rather than filed, so the count
// is "defects outstanding" and not "issues created".
//
// One per scenario rather than one per attempt, because the no-progress rule
// compares WORKING-SET SIZES: an agent that repairs two of three failures takes
// the set from 3 to 1, which reads as progress and lets the loop continue. A
// single issue listing all three cannot be closed until every one is fixed, so the
// same partial repair would look like a cycle that changed nothing and fail the
// run. The granularity is nearly free — a coding cycle is scoped to the milestone,
// so N issues still cost one cycle.
//
// report is the bytes read at the validation cycle's own merge commit; the caller
// owns that read because it already performs it for the verdict. An empty or
// all-green report mints nothing, which is not an error — it is what "there was
// nothing to repair" looks like.
//
// A defect keeps ONE issue across attempts. The dedupe key is the scenario alone,
// so an attempt that meets a scenario still failing resolves onto its open issue
// and leaves the current evidence there as a comment, rather than filing a second
// issue beside the first. See DedupeKeyValidationFix for why the attempt used to
// be part of that key and why it cannot have been buying what it claimed.
